# ðŸ“Š Simple Linear Regression Model - Height vs Weight

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a **Linear Regression** model using Python's `scikit-learn` to predict a personâ€™s weight based on their height. The dataset includes height, weight, and age fields, and the model is trained after cleaning, handling missing values, and removing outliers.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Cleaned real-world data with missing values and outliers
- Filled missing data using group-wise average based on age
- Removed outliers using Z-score method
- Built a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated model performance using RÂ² Score, RMSE, and Adjusted RÂ²
- Plotted Actual vs Predicted results

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Age` (int)
- `Height_cm` (float)
- `Weight_kg` (float)
